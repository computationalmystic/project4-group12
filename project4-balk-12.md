#Max's project 4 (assignment 7) readme
##rationale and team assessment 
* We chose vanilla web technologies because the project originally had a much shorter timeframe.
  * I wanted it to be possible for each member of the group to produce something that worked 
* There didnt seem to be much of a need for any sort of multiple page approach
  * even working in the same javascript file we didn't really need to touch each other's methods.. easy to merge
* I (max) hashed out the JS fetch request method and made the interface. I also wrote the getTopCommitters committerGraph function
  * Davin and Ziang made the and getPUllAcceptanceRate/pullGraph and getIssues/drawIssueGraph function pairs, respectively. 
* I chose the google charts api for the graphs because it was the first result on google (wonder why) and had good documentation
